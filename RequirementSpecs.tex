\section{Introduction}
This section gives a scope description and overview of everything included in this Software Requirements Specification document. Also, the purpose of this document is described and a list of abbreviations and definitions is provided. 
	\subsection{Purpose}
	The purpose of this document is to describe the detailed requirements for the NavUP application which are precise and testable. It illustrates the purpose and complete declaration for the development of the application and the development methodology that will be used is agile within which the application functionality is developed iteratively. It also explains application constraints, interface and interactions to the external applications. This document is primarily intended to be proposed to a client for its approval and a reference for developing the first version of the application for the development team. 
	\subsection{Scope}
	The NavUP is a mobile application that uses the campus WiFi to deliver an information service to users on their smart devices. It helps students, visitors and university employees to locate venues and to determine the best route to the venues on the Hatfield Campus of the University of Pretoria depending on the user’s current location and restrictions around the location. The application should be free to download from either a mobile phone application store or similar services. The NavUP application main purpose is to provide navigation on the Hatfield Campus and will provide navigation to any other Campus or any other location outside the University of Pretoria. \newline
	
	University can provide information about venues, events and public services such as shops, restaurants and ablution facilities using the web-portal. This information will act as the bases for the search results displayed to the user. An administrator also uses the web portal in order to administer the application and keep the information accurate.
\newline

Furthermore, the application needs both WiFi and GPS connection to fetch and display results. All application information is maintained in a database, which is located on a web server. The application also interacts with the GPS-Navigator software which is required to be an already installed application on the user’s mobile phone. By using the GPS-Navigator, users can view desired interest points on a map and be navigated to them. The application also has the capability of providing visualised information related to pedestrian traffic, and can be trained to push new information to users according to their preferences and interests.\newline

Student, staff and guest of the University of Pretoria will benefit from NavUP, since it will alleviate congestion on the Hatfield Campus and provide a medium for a more connected and informed Campus community.

	\subsection{Overview}
	The remainder of this document includes two chapters. The second chapter provides an overview of the application functionality and application interaction with other systems. This chapter also introduces different types of stakeholders and their interaction with the application. Further, the chapter also mentions the system constraints and assumptions about the product.\newline

The third chapter provides the requirements specification in detailed terms and a description of the different system interfaces. Different specification techniques are used in order to specify the requirements more precisely for different audiences.

\section{Overall Description}
NavUP's main function will be to provide navigation to the user on the Hatfield Campus of the University of Pretoria. The navigation application will be accompanied with functions like, optimised route calculations based on shortest route and least congested route. NavUP will also allow the user to share location with a friend and provide navigation to a friend location on Campus.\newline

NavUP provides other functions with the intent of informing the user of all that the Campus can offer, NavUP will provide functionality to the user which will allow the user to view detailed information about the location the user is currently at or any location the user searched for. Furthermore, the user will be able to save frequent or favourite location to easily navigate to frequented locations
NavUP also focuses on entertainment and social side of the University of Pretoria by allowing the user to discover or create events that may occur at the many locations on Hatfield Campus.\newline


Crowd-sourcing will play a pivotal role in the NavUP application. Users will be able to review buildings, restaurants or other services on Hatfield campuses. Furthermore, the user will be able to report any problem on the campus which in turn will improve navigation for other users. The continued usage of the application by the users will allow the system to create heat maps of busy location or slow moving locations thus allowing even further optimisation to the navigation experience.\newline

The user will also be rewarded for their contribution to the application. NavUP will allow the user to play treasure hunt games or travel games, further an achievement system will allow the user to show off or compare between friends their level of contribution to the application.\newline
	\subsection{Product Perspective}
		NavUp is a product that is the first of its kind. No system has yet been developed like NavUP. The navigation system will be built from the ground up to adapt to the specific needs of the student, staff, and guest of the University of Pretoria. However, NavUP will be making use of GIS technologies and databases to map Hatfield Campus grounds. These technologies will also be used to map the interiors of the buildings on Campus.\newline
		\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
			NavUP will provide a simplistic, easy-to-use interface, with additional accessibility features for those with disabilities. The register and login interfaces will be minimalistic, yet descriptive, and will be easy to use. Once logged in the user will encounter a map interface which will serve as the home interface for NavUP.\newline

The home interface will provide a large search bar on the top of the screen to search for location on the Hatfield Campus. This search bar will also provide voice search functionality to accommodate for disability needs. When the search bar is selected two separate buttons will emerge. One will allow the user to display where the user is now on the Hatfield Campus. The other will provide the options to read the location information. The Map will form part of two separate interfaces.\newline

A separate heat map button will be placed in the lower right-hand corner of the screen. If heat map is active a legend will appear where the search bar was and the colour of the map will change depending on the map congestion. The colour displayed on the heat map will also take into consideration people who suffer from colour blindness.\newline

A separate button will be in the lower left-hand corner of the screen. This button will lead to a different interface which will provide options to separate functionality like Account, Announcements, Events and Games.\newline

The Account interface will consist of radio buttons and check boxes which will provide the user with a list preferences. The Announcements interface will be in a blog-like form and will display NavUP latest announcements. Games interface will indicate the user achievements in an upper banner, the reset of the interface will provide options to different games.\newline

Notification will make use of the device operating system to provide push notification to the user. The interface will remain the same across all devices whilst adapting the resolution to different screen sizes.
		\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
			NavUP will be able to run on any Android and IOS device which support Wi-fi connectivity. Other Recommend Hardware that can improve the NavUp experience but not necessary would be built in GPS functionality. NavUP will also make use of the Wi-fi routers and signal extender on Hatfield campus to improve navigation capabilities.
		\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
			NavUP will make use of GIS technologies and databases which will be provided by the University of Pretoria. NavUP will make use of the same database technologies that are being used by the University of Pretoria Library and admin system to ensure continuity between different systems of the University.
		\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}
			NavUP will make use of HTTPS to communicate between device and server. Communication between devices and Wi-Fi connectors will makes user of the IEE 802.11 standard.  Furthermore, communication medium like email will be used for system announcement. The main mode of communication will be the NavUP UI.
		\subsubsection{Memory}
			The application will not use more than 5 MB of memory for installation and not more than 10 MB for execution. It will therefore be required for the mobile device to have secondary memory that is greater than 50 MB for optimal performance of the application. It will require a system of preferably 1 GB of memory to perform optimally. Due to the processing that the application may do it will most likely take about +- 50 Mb of the mobile device's main memory. The user profiles will be backed up on the system side to enable recovery in an event something goes wrong. The profiles will also be stored in the user’s mobile devices cache to enable faster loading of the application.
		%\subsubsection{Site Adaptation Requirements}
	\subsection{Product Functions}
		NavUP will be designed to provide directions from the user’s current location to the desired destination. There will be options for the route calculation based on the user’s needs; fastest route, least-congested route, and a route that best accommodates for those with disability. The system will also store information of the plentiful landmarks and points of interest that are present on campus, users will be able to view this information when visiting each one of these locations. Activities will also be integrated into the system that makes use of geolocation, activities that tracks walking data of a user and rewards them for it, as well as activities like treasure hunts that will make use of Geocaching. NavUP will provide statistical data, by storing routes and locations of users, it will facilitate heatmap displays and potentially most/least used routes. NavUP will also notify users about entertainment and social events on the UP Campus. The system should be able to deal with varying strengths of WiFi signal as there are distances between access points, in cases where signal is lost completely, NavUP will need to extrapolate from the known walks to draw the complete path the user has travelled.
	\subsection{User Characteristics}
		While NavUP will be mainly targeted for visitors and new students, it will have functionality to attract many more users including staff and even students that are nearing the completion of their degrees. The typical user will be a matriculant that is not familiar with the Hatfield campus, they will not necessarily be very technologically-savvy but will have the basic knowledge to work with straightforward apps that they download on their smart device. They will also be very curious about the various buildings’ histories of the campus such that they use NavUP to walk around campus and learn about the landmarks and points of interest, as well as take part in the various activities that make use of the geolocation. The other user will be more experienced with the campus, students that have been there for a longer period of time, and even the staff themselves. Some of these users will have privileges such as the day house leaders and events coordinators, they will fall under the trusted user category which will afford them administrative privileges such as event creation or even to trigger an evacuation in an emergency that may endanger student safety; such as protest action or in the case of a fire.
